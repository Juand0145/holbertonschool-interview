# 0x14. Heap Extract
Data structures
Please use the following data structures and types for binary trees. Donâ€™t forget to include them in your header file.

/**
 * struct binary_tree_s - Binary tree node
 *
 * @n: Integer stored in the node
 * @parent: Pointer to the parent node
 * @left: Pointer to the left child node
 * @right: Pointer to the right child node
 */
struct binary_tree_s
{
    int n;
    struct binary_tree_s *parent;
    struct binary_tree_s *left;
    struct binary_tree_s *right;
};

typedef struct binary_tree_s binary_tree_t;

Function that extracts the root node of a Max Binary Heap:

Prototype: int heap_extract(heap_t **root);
root is a double pointer to the root node of the heap
Your function must return the value stored in the root node
The root node must be freed and replace with the last level-order node of the heap
Once replaced, the heap must be rebuilt if necessary
If your function fails, return 0
